* use whatever username the user is running as? how to set the username to run this all as? Right now is vagrant
* This keeps coming up:

```
Notice: /Stage[main]/Saio/Service[rsyslog]: Triggered 'refresh' from 2 events
```

* vagrant user in *-server.conf files
* try to use puppet's version of lineinefile instead of so many files
* break everything out into smaller files
* use hiera to set username
* is this not all run as root anyways?
