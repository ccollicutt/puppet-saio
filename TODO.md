TODO
====

* move class params to params.pp properly
* cleanup puppet.sh
* fix hostname warning
* try to use puppet's version of lineinefile instead of so many templates and files
* break everything out into smaller files
* use hiera?
* rebuild swift/swiftclient when new code is pulled in by vcsrepo
* make swift_hash a requirement to set, can't figure out any other way to do that
* have vagrant create the init.pp file? then hash could be created once, also IP/hostanme could be set
* add a link in the users home dir back to /usr/local/src/swift
